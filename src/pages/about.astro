  <h1>About My Astro Blog</h1>
  <h2>About Page subtitle</h2>
    <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>
    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="skill">My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li class="skill">I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
      {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
      <li class="skill">Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
      }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

    {goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
